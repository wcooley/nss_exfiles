README for nss_exfiles
======================

nss_exfiles is an NSS module which allows file-based naming service outside
of those normally used in /etc.  This is easier for disconnected remote
hosts, for which the infrastructure of a network-based naming service, such
as LDAP or NIS, would be overkill or a liability, but without the risks of
synchronizing /etc files.

This code is currently in development.  Please do not attempt to use.
