Short term
==========
* Conf:
** Design & implement structures & routines
*** Open main conf, parse & build
*** Iterate through conf struct and open files?
*** Replace strlist with fnodelist
**** Or open db files only when/if necessary?

* Conf parser:
** Write tests for parser

* Complete passwd & group support
** Need to determine what remains--mostly just group, I think.
** Need to write & run some tests
* Complete passwd & group test coverage
* Verify nothing terribly dumb performance-wise
* Write docs

* Think about locking & threading
** Is it necessary to lock? Does a set/get+/end "transaction" happen only in
one thread?
** Verify correctness in threaded environment

Short term - Done
-----------------
** Resurrect strlist code; forgot I'd written it for implementing the parsed
config data structures
** Add prefix to support multiple Yacc parsers
** Re-write conf parser using scanf instead of lex/yacc.

Short term - Scrapped
---------------------
** Enable re-entrancy for parser w/lex/yacc?

Longer term
===========
* Solaris support
* Netgroup support
* shadow/gshadow support
* Support globbing in conf file?
* Improve automake/conf/libtool use
** Find way to skip checks if 'check' is not installed
