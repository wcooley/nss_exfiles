Short term
==========
* Conf parser:
** Resurrect strlist code; forgot I'd written it for implementing the parsed
config data structures
** Finish implementing parser by having it build data structures
** Write tests for parser
** Add prefix to support multiple Yacc parsers
* Complete passwd & group support
** Need to determine what remains--mostly just group, I think.
* Verify correctness in threaded environment
** Need to write & run some tests
* Complete passwd & group test coverage
* Verify nothing terribly dumb performance-wise
* Write docs

Longer term
===========
* Solaris support
* Netgroup support
* shadow/gshadow support?
